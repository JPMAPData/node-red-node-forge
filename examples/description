Node Red is a flow based rapid prototyping solution for javascript originally developed
by IBM b at non has a large of contributing community.

In simple terms 'nodes' (blocks) are wired together to enable messages to pass between them.
The functionality of the nodes is where the power of Node Red comes into play.
The blocks in side simple value setting and condition checking up to integrations with external
services such as sending tweets via the twitter api or posting to slack for example.
The ability for users to create their own nodes and distribute them through the NPM system
further expands the capabilities to interacting with pretty much anything that has an API.

'Node-Red-Contrib-Forge' is one such package which is a collection of nodes with the sole
purpose of simplifying the interaction with various Forge services (like OSS,
Data Managment, Model Derivative, etc).
