<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="traffic">
    <p>A node that filters messages using its controlled state as a traffic light. When the <i>allow</i> regexp matches the <i>allow</i> property value for the incoming message, the node will be in <b>allow</b> state and will send further incoming messages. As for the <i>allow</i> principle, the node will switch in <b>stop</b> mode if the <i>stop</i> regexp matches the <i>stop</i> property value for the incoming message and will not send any new incoming message.</p>
  <p>It is possible to negate the regex</p>
  <p>Traffic may be stored while not allowed and freed once allowed<p>
